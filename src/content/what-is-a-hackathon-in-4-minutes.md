40 hours of intense focus. Prolonged sleepless deprivation. Nerve-wracking stressed out moments. Unexpected friendship formations. Proud working prototype to bring home.

Yes, all that is described above is just some of the fun that you will experience in joining a hackathon, but there is ao much more to it.

###### Marathon or Hackathon?

## A Marathon To Hack Things? 🤔

The common misconception is to tap into our cognitive bias and just assume that a hackathon is a marathon. One funny story that happened to me was during one of my clinic appointment.

The doctor eventually told me to not do any physical activity, and I told him that I will be participating in a hackathon that weekend. He assumed I was going for a 10km marathon because Music Run, a literal marathon, was also happening in the same week.

After explaining, he calmed down and concluded the session with assurance.

## So, What Is A Hackathon?

> A hackathon is an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming - lexico.com.

In simple terms, it is often a 24 hours(or longer) event where 2–5 members are formed as a team to solve problems by coming up with a basic prototype to showcase to the judges.

A hackathon could be as niche as a virtual reality hackathon or as broad as just a general hackathon.

For example, if the hackathon's theme is drone, you will be expected to come up with a working solution for the drone industry. After the hack time, there will be judges(often industry experts) to come and judge your prototypes.

###### Money, money, money!

## Wait, You Can Earn RM1,500 In An Event? 🤑

Hackathons often come with cash prizes to award the best among the best too. And yes, it is possible to just quit your job and just earn money through hackathons, provided if you keep winning. But don't do it, please don't.

Nonetheless, there is often as much as RM16,000 as a total prize pool in some hackathons, or even RM8,000 as grand prize winner. Yes, that just meant a possibility of RM4,000 per team member, if your team only consists of 2 members.

Sometimes, you can even secure conference tickets or additional incubator program slots for you to develop your solution into an existing product in the market.

## But Why Join A Hackathon?

Now, I think joining a hackathon is an eye-opening experience. Whether you win or not, it doesn't matter, because your mind will just be blown for the first-ever time.

Did I also mention that hackathons tickets are usually very affordable for most people? In Malaysia, it's usually around the price of RM30, in my opinion.

### 1. You will always gain a new experience

Every hackathon you join will always be different. With different team members, atmosphere, food, itinerary of hackathons and theme, the way you approach and comprehend your hackathon experience will also be different.

You could potentially gain new industry skills as well from any moment during the event, which could increase your value in the market.

### 2. Networking in the community

There will be tons of people who will join too, especially people who are very active in the community.

That way, you will get the opportunity to know them and add them to your contacts. Having more contacts in your Linkedin could be somewhat beneficial to you in the future.

### 3. Cash Prizes

As mentioned above, there will be tons of attractive prizes everywhere in most hackathons. Most of the time, you will also have free meals and freebies that you will get.

Not to mention cool stickers that people stick on their laptops, promo codes to try new apps, or even t-shirts that are comfortable and beautiful.

### 4. Efficiency Boost

Working under stress could be mentally exhausting, but sometimes a good 2-day productivity hustle can increase your efficiency dramatically.

This is because you will be performing under the biggest factor of all time, which is time itself.

### 5. An opportunity to exhibit your skills

Joining a hackathon shows that you are passionate about software engineering. Even if you lack experience or confidence, you will be allowed to just try your best as a team to make a working prototype that you can bring home at the end of the day.

On top of that, it is a good way to show what you can build to people because judges and other people will be interested to see what you built!

###### Stop thinking and just join it!

## Are Hackathons Only For Professional Coders? 🎓

The short answer is no.

Hackathons come in all shapes and sizes. Some are relatively larger and scarier in terms of their niche or target audience. For example, a hackathon that only allows university students won't have the same difficulty as compared to the hackathon for financial technology.

My take on this is to research on what type of hackathon you would like to participate in and sharpen your coding skills to make sure that you can contribute enough to the team.

If you are not a tech person, you could always help out in things like business development and design. But once again, always make sure that you can provide value on the table.

## Closing Thoughts 😄

I genuinely think that everyone should try to join a hackathon in their lifetime, especially people who are in the technology industry.

You don't need to win a cash prize to gain an experience that money cannot buy, so don't hesitate to always try out new things.
